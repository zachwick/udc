data about potential Underdog.io candidates

## Data

The data for this web app is fetched from:

    http://underdog-candidates.herokuapp.com/candidates

## Deployment Requirements

For development purposes, all JS libraries are loaded from the project
directory. This is sub-optimal for production deployment where the JS
libraries should be loaded from a CDN.
