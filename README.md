udc - Underdog.io Candidates

# Introduction

This is a simple pure JS web app that uses ReactJS to display some
data about potential Underdog.io candidates

## Data

The data for this web app is fetched from:

    http://underdog-candidates.herokuapp.com/candidates


## Build Requirements

None


## Deployment Requirements

For development purposes, all JS libraries are loaded from the project
directory. This is sub-optimal for production deployment where the JS
libraries should be loaded from a CDN.


# What I learned doing this

- I kind of like the JSX markup. JSX:HTML+JS (in Backbone)::LESS:CSS
    - It feels less magic than Angular, which is a good thing :)
- You cannot put JS comments inside of a JSX block. This makes sense
in retrospect
